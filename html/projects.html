          These projects are based on videos i have found online and adapted for
          myself, simply to practice my CSS. When i started the web development
          course i knew that, if i want to have success, i need to work extra.
          First i have drawn myself, then my dog Pucca. After i have drawn my
          dog, i felt i had to give my cat justice, as i do not have favorites,
          i love them both the same.

          <li>I would love to animate my drawings, to give them life;</li>
          <li>
            Create "Pucca the Pug" in the same format as "Tora the Cat" so i can
            make them interact in a separate project;
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve the coloring so i can make them look more real. Given the
            fact that my pets are not plain colored, i used gradient to create a
            multi-colored effect.

          The project I am most proud of:

          I was really happy when the teacher gave us this homework because it
          was exciting to feel like i am creating my own game, even though it is
          based on a simple algorithm. It was also one of my first interactions
          with JavaScript and i think i did a pretty good job for a beginner.

            Create a hard mode: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. The modes will
